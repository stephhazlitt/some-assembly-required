#### My Comments

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on the use of the McLoughlin Amenity Funds. It is an exciting time for the Township of Esquimalt, investing $17 million dollars in capital improvements to waterfront parks, community recreation facilities and public safety facilities. I would like some of the McLoughlin Amenity Funds directed towards replacement and enhancement of the aged and dilapidated playgrounds at L'Ecole Macaulay Elementary at 1010 Wychbury Avenue (south-east side). Enrollment for Macaulay Elementary this year is over 470 children. The Macaulay Elementary school grounds provide recreational green space, playground equipment and act as a community hub for hundreds of Esquimalt families. While not included for discussion in the phase two public engagement, in my opinion L'Ecole Macaulay Elementary is as central an amenity in Esquimalt as the many other important waterfront and downtown locations listed (e.g. Macaulay Point, Bullen Park, other waterfront parks). Healthy, inclusive communities start with healthy, inclusive schools&mdash;please consider investing some of the McLoughlin Amenity Funds into a fully accessible, safe playground for hundreds of kids living in Esquimalt.
